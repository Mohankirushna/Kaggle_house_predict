# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more using machine learning techniques.

## 🏠 Overview
The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates house prices from historical data.

## 🛠️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R² score

## 💻 Usage
1. Load your house price dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or local CSV file).
2. Run the notebook/script to train and evaluate the model.
3. Use the trained model to predict prices for new data.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
